## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **API Requirements**:
   - Upbit requires IP whitelisting for API access
   - Both exchanges require trading permissions enabled
   - Withdrawal permissions needed for live trading

2. **Network Fees**:
   - Each cryptocurrency has different withdrawal fees
   - USDT transfers use TRC20 network by default (lower fees)
   - Fees are calculated as percentage in the bot

3. **Market Risks**:
   - Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile
   - Transfer times can vary significantly (1-30 minutes)
   - Exchange maintenance can interrupt operations
   - Slippage can reduce profits

4. **Compliance**:
   - Ensure compliance with local regulations
   - Be aware of tax implications
   - Some jurisdictions restrict arbitrage trading

## ‚ö° Performance Tips

1. **Optimal Configuration**:
   - Start with small trade amounts
   - Use paper trading to find optimal parameters
   - Monitor the dashboard for system performance
   - Adjust safety margin based on volatility

2. **Network Optimization**:
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Consider running on a VPS near exchange servers
   - Use appropriate regional endpoints

3. **Risk Management**:
   - Never invest more than you can afford to lose
   - Start with paper trading
   - Gradually increase trade sizes
   - Monitor daily volumes and profits
   - Set appropriate emergency stop loss

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Insufficient balance" errors in paper trading**: 
   - Check virtual balance initialization
   - Verify ticker parsing logic (KRW-BTC format)

2. **API connection errors**:
   - Verify API keys and secret keys
   - Check IP whitelist on Upbit
   - Ensure trading permissions are enabled

3. **No arbitrage opportunities detected**:
   - Normal during low volatility periods
   - Check if safety margin is too high
   - Verify USDT premium calculation

4. **Dashboard not loading**:
   - Check if port 8050 is available
   - Verify ENABLE_DASHBOARD is not set to false

5. **Orderbook access failures**:
   - Usually IP whitelist issue on Upbit
   - Bot will skip problematic coins after 5 failures

### Debug Mode:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG DRY_RUN=true python main.py
```
